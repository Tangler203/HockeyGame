## A two player hockey game

This is a Hockey Game I helped make for an Internship at Avaya. It is a simple 2 player game where the goal is to put the ball into the
opponent's net.

## Controls:

  Player 1(Green square) | Player 2(Purple Square)
  
    Up: W                |  Up Arrow Key
    
    Down: S              |  Down Arrow Key
    
    Left: A              |  Left Arrow Key
    
    Right: D             |  Right Arrow Key
    
    
   ##  Issues:
   
   Hit collision is still an issue(i.e Ball can go in unexpected direction)
   
   Ball can go through net at times.
